## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
historical_data <- read_csv("~/march-madness-predictor/data/Bio_185_March_Madness_Data.csv")
```

```{r}
favorite_maximum_round <- historical_data %>%
  group_by(Favorite, Year) %>%
  mutate(maximum_round_favorite = max(Round)) %>%
  select(Year, Favorite, Underdog, Round, maximum_round_favorite)
```

```{r}
underdog_maximum_round <- historical_data %>%
  group_by(Underdog, Year) %>%
  mutate(maximum_round_underdog = max(Round)) %>%
  select(Year, Favorite, Underdog, Round, maximum_round_underdog)
```

```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round <- full_join(favorite_maximum_round, underdog_maximum_round, by = c("Year" = "Year", "Favorite" = "Favorite", "Underdog" = "Underdog", "Round" = "Round"))
```


### This is right but we don't have the right "max" should be basically the idea is filter for the last time team "x" pops up in a year as either a favorite or an underdog and what round was it
```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round <- aggregate_maximum_round %>%
  mutate(total_max_round = (maximum_round_favorite + maximum_round_underdog))
```
