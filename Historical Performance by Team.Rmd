## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
historical_data <- read_csv("~/march-madness-predictor/data/Bio_185_March_Madness_Data.csv")
```

```{r}
favorite_maximum_round <- historical_data %>%
  group_by(Favorite, Year) %>%
  mutate(maximum_round_favorite = max(Round)) %>%
  select(Year, Favorite, maximum_round_favorite)
```

```{r}
underdog_maximum_round <- historical_data %>%
  group_by(Underdog, Year) %>%
  mutate(maximum_round_underdog = max(Round)) %>%
  select(Year, Underdog, maximum_round_underdog)
```

```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round <- full_join(favorite_maximum_round, underdog_maximum_round, by = c("Year" = "Year", "Favorite" = "Underdog"))
```

```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round$maximum_round_favorite[is.na(aggregate_maximum_round$maximum_round_favorite)] <- 0
aggregate_maximum_round$maximum_round_underdog[is.na(aggregate_maximum_round$maximum_round_underdog)] <- 0
```


```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round <- aggregate_maximum_round %>%
  group_by(Year, Favorite) %>%
  mutate(final_round = pmax(maximum_round_favorite, maximum_round_underdog)) %>%
  rename("Team" = "Favorite") %>%
  select(Year, Team, final_round) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(desc(Year), Team)
```


```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round <- aggregate_maximum_round %>%
  mutate(Round_Reached = factor(final_round,
                              levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
         labels = c("First Round", "Second Round", "Sweet Sixteen", "Elite Eight", "Final Four", "Championship Game")))
```

```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round$Year <- round(aggregate_maximum_round$Year, digits = 0)
```

### Graph is set. Just want to change the format from year to a date format to make the x axis of the graph discrete so we can see year by year on the x axis.
```{r}
aggregate_maximum_round %>%
  filter(Team == "UNC") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Round_Reached)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(aggregate_maximum_round$Year), max(aggregate_maximum_round$Year), by = 1))
```
