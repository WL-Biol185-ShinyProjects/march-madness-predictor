## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
new_data <- read_csv("~/march-madness-predictor/data/final_four_conference_data.csv")
```



```{r}
new_data <- new_data %>%
  select(Year, Conference) %>%
  count(Conference, Year)
```


```{r}
new_data <- new_data %>%
  group_by(Conference, n) %>%
  count()
```
### Renaming variables here
```{r}
new_data <- new_data %>%
  rename("Number of Teams from the Conference in the Final Four" = "n",
         "Number of Times Occurred" = "nn")
```

```{r}
new_data <- new_data %>%
  mutate(prob_occurence = (`Number of Times Occurred` / 83)*100)
```
### How to round prob occurence if needed
```{r}
new_data$prob_occurence <- round(new_data$prob_occurence, digits = 0)
```
### How to add a percentage to prob occurence
```{r}
new_data$prob_occurence <- paste0(new_data$prob_occurence, "%")
```


```{r}
write.csv(new_data, file = "conference_predictor.csv")
```
